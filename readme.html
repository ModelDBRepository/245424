Function and energy consumption constrain neuronal biophysics in a
canonical computation: coincidence detection

</p>
<p>The model is of a single neuron from the auditory brainstem (from the
MSO nucleus). It is written in C-code that is run and analyzed from
Matlab.</p>
Demo:<p/>
Type Full_run_demo on the Matlab command prompt.  After the MEX files are compiled you should see text output and prompts to run a few more times, accompanied by a graph with similar traces as displayed in Figure 2A in the paper, for example:
